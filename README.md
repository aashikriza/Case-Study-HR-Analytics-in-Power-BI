# Case Study HR Data Analysis with Power BI

This repository contains materials and documentation for a Power BI case study focused on analyzing Human Resources (HR) data for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This course focuses on helping import, analyze, and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. Building on existing knowledge of the platform, this case study demonstrates how to effectively work with Power BI using example data.

I carried out exploratory data analysis and used DAX to help build powerful visualizations. The analysis concludes by diving deeper into attrition and identifying factors that impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they need to take to retain more employees.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of five tables:

1. **Employee Details**
   - Contains detailed information about the employees.

2. **Performance Rating**
   - Includes performance ratings for the employees.

3. **Educational Level**
   - Provides information about the educational qualifications of the employees.

4. **Rating Level**
   - Details the rating levels assigned to the rating ID.

5. **Satisfaction Level**
   - Captures the satisfaction levels assigned to the satifaction ID.

## Analysis

The analysis carried out in this case study includes:

- Importing and cleaning the HR dataset in Power BI
- Creating relationships between the tables
- Building visualizations to explore different aspects of the HR data
- Using DAX to create calculated columns and measures
- Diving deeper into employee attrition and analyzing factors that impact attrition
- Providing recommendations to Atlas Labs based on the analysis

## Visualizations

Some of the key visualizations created during the analysis include:

- Employee demographics and distribution
- Performance ratings and their trends over time
- Educational levels across different departments
- Employee satisfaction levels
- Attrition rates and factors influencing attrition

Here are some sample images of the visualizations:
