# Case Study HR Data Analysis with Power BI

This repository contains materials and documentation for a Power BI case study focused on analyzing Human Resources (HR) data for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This course focuses on helping import, analyze, and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. Building on existing knowledge of the platform, this case study demonstrates how to effectively work with Power BI using example data.

I carried out exploratory data analysis and used DAX to help build powerful visualizations. The analysis concludes by diving deeper into attrition and identifying factors that impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they need to take to retain more employees.

4. **Rating Level**
   - Details the rating levels assigned to employees based on various metrics.

5. **Satisfaction Level**
   - Captures the satisfaction levels of employees.

## Analysis

The analysis carried out in this case study includes:

- Importing and cleaning the HR dataset in Power BI
- Creating relationships between the tables
- Building visualizations to explore different aspects of the HR data
